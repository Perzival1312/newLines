# newLines

A functional live website that takes a source text and generates a random sentence
that sounds like it could have come from the source but didn't.

## Future

1. possibly re-write in C#
2. Attain and use a custom domain name
3. Overhaul UI

### Continuation/offshoot idea
#### Make it change the tone of a user entered sentence to a selected tone
